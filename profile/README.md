Do you remember that feeling when you wore your favourite top or trouser? The jumper, that no many how many holes or tattered it was, every time you wore it, it gave you a feeling of comfort a sense of calm. Or your Power clothes, which when you wore, it made your sense of purpose even more distinct. You were on a mission that day, and no matter what, things were going to get done.

When it comes to apparel, in our humble opinion, there is no better place to start than your feet. The shoes you wear convey a message. The [University of Kansas](http://www.sportsonesource.com/news/fbu/fbu_article.asp?section=2&Prod=5&id=43084) recently released a study that came to the following findings:
- Expensive shoes belonged to high earners.
- Flashy and colorful footwear belonged to extroverts.
- Shoes that were not new but appeared to be spotless belonged to conscientious types.
- Practical and functional shoes generally belonged to agreeable people.
- Ankle boots fitted with more aggressive personalities.
- Uncomfortable looking shoes were worn by calm personalities.

The way people see you is how they will interact with you. Want to command a room, dress for power and watch the room follow your every word. Want to be heard, be bold in what you wear, the room already noticed you.
